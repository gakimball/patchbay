Patchbay
========

Patchbay is a jQuery plugin which helps you construct audio players for a site or web app, which hook into a single "master" audio player. By pairing this with a tool for constructing single-page web apps like [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) or [Ajaxify](https://github.com/browserstate/ajaxify), you can make an audio player that keeps playing music even as the user browses the site. I developed a similar library for my side project [Polymath](http://www.polymatharts.com), and now I've developed it into a library.

Still a work in progress.
